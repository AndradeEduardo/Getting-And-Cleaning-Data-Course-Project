This repository contains the following files:

## README.md
This is the file you are reading right now. It contains the description of this repository.

## CodeBook.md
This file describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that were performed to clean up the data.

## run_analysis.R
This file is the R script that performs all data acquiring, cleaning, transforming and recording.
The script within it has the following conventions:

1) Comments starting with one # indicates a comment on the code of the line below it

2) Comment starting with three # indicates a comment regarding the logics of the code below it in order to fulfill a requirement of the project. The requirement being addressed is explicitly indicated by its number.

Some commands, like #View(targetActivitiesData) and #dim(targetActivitiesData) were left commented in order to help evaluate the correctness of the operations previously performed on code.
