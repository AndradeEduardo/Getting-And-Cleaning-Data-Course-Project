# Getting and Cleanin Data Course Project Code Book

This file describes the variables, the data, and transformations performed to clean up the source data and generate the target data required in this project.

## Overview

This project aimed to get data generated by a research on Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data, clean this data according to the requirements stated below and generate an output dataset containing the average of measures that represent mean and standard deviation variables in the source data.

Information about this research can be obtained at: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

## Source Data

The source data of this project can be obtained at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00240/UCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Information about the source data set can be obtained at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00240/UCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The source data comes in zip compact format and in order to be used, it need to be extracted to the working directory.
The following files were used in this project:
* activity_labels.txt: contains the names of the activities performed by the subjects of the research and the IDs of these names
* features.txt: contains the names of the variables obtained in the observations of the research and their IDs
* /train/X_train.txt: contains data obtained by the training group
* /train/y_train.txt: contains the IDs of the activities performed during training activities
* /train/subject_train.txt: contains the IDs of the subjects that performed training activities</BR>
These three files have the same number of lines since each observation refers to an activity performed by a subject
* /test/X_test.txt
* /test/y_test.txt
* /test/subject_test.txt</BR>
The three files above are analog to the three training files, but they refer to test data.
